### Personal Assistant Chatbot

This repository contains code for a personal assistant chatbot that was developed as a learning project to explore the OpenAI API. The chatbot allows users to share their thoughts and receive responses from an AI-powered language model based on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo model. The Gradio library is used to create an easy-to-use interface for users.

### How to Use
To use the chatbot, simply run the main.py file and navigate to the URL displayed in the console. You can then enter your messages in the input box and receive responses from the chatbot in the output box. The chatbot is pre-trained to act as a personal assistant and respond to a variety of user inputs.

### Prerequisites
To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the openai and gradio Python packages. You will also need an API key from OpenAI to access the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. Follow the instructions in the OpenAI API documentation to obtain an API key.

### Customization
The chatbot can be easily customized to suit your specific needs. You can modify the CustomChatGPT function in the main.py file to change the behavior of the chatbot. For example, you could train a new language model on your own dataset and use it to power the chatbot.
